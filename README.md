# Hardware-Efficient Accurate and Approximate Multipliers Using Booth Encoding

This project focuses on the design of FPGA-optimized accurate and approximate multipliers for use in error-tolerant applications like 5G wireless communication. Two multiplier architectures were developed: one accurate using Booth encoding, and one approximate using LSB truncation with probabilistic compensation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Description

The project implements and compares:

- **Area-Mult**: An accurate 10√ó10 multiplier based on Booth encoding.
- **Pro-AppT8**: A 10√ó10 approximate multiplier that uses LSB truncation and a probability-based correction mechanism.

These designs aim to balance accuracy, performance, area, and power for use in FPGA-based low-power systems.

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Xilinx Vivado 2018.3**
- **Verilog HDL / VHDL**
- **Vivado Simulator**
- **Power and Timing Analyzer**

## üöÄ Key Features

- Booth encoding for reduced partial products.
- Accurate multiplier with full-width addition.
- Approximate multiplier with LSB truncation and error compensation.
- Resource-optimized designs for FPGA implementation.
- Testbenches for validation using sample test cases.
